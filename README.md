## Where I got this idea

    - I got this idea because of my sister in law who is in middle school who struggles with anxiety, depression and self harm due to bullying including mental and physical at a previous school. I wanted to create a space for her to express herself and feel safe to share her thoughts and feelings without judgement.

## What I learned

    - I learned how to use the Google OAuth2 API to authenticate users and how to use the Amplify framework to host the website.

## What this project includes

    - A landing page with a carousel of images to promote the website
    - A sign in/sign up page with a form validation
    - A dashboard with a daily quote via an api, a space to write your thoughts, a space to rate your mood and a space to view your past thoughts.
    - A form to add new thoughts to the database
    - A delete function to delete thoughts from the database
    - A edit function to edit thoughts in the database
    - Mobile responsiveness

## What I would do differently

    - I would honestly change this into a react page or maybe use next.js next time.
    - I would do some cleaner code
    - I would maybe like to do something associated with AWS Amplify and some Lambda functions
